# ðŸ“Š Scrape LinkedIn Competitorsâ€™ Posts with n8n + Apify + Google Sheets

This workflow automates the process of **scraping LinkedIn posts from competitors or creators**, filtering by engagement (reposts > 20 in this case), and storing the results in **Google Sheets** for analysis.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Schedule Trigger / Manual Trigger**  
   - Runs weekly (or on-demand with manual trigger).  

2. **Google Sheets â€“ Competitor List**  
   - Reads a list of competitor LinkedIn profile URLs from a Google Sheet.  

3. **Loop Over Items**  
   - Iterates over each LinkedIn profile.  

4. **Profile Scraping (Apify API)**  
   - Fetches recent posts, captions, engagement (likes, comments, reposts), and published date.  

5. **Filter**  
   - Only keeps posts with **more than 20 reposts** (can be customized).  

6. **Google Sheets â€“ Save Results**  
   - Appends filtered posts into another sheet (`Linkedin Posts`) with details:  
     - Creator Name  
     - Post URL  
     - Caption/Text  
     - Likes  
     - Comments  
     - Reposts  
     - Published Date
